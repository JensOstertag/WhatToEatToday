# WhatToEatToday

WhatToEatToday is a Website built to decide over a quick and easy weeknight Meal.

## How to Use

### Food Types

Start by selecting the Food Type you want to generate. By now, you can choose between a complete Dinner, that consists of a Side and a Main Dish. In Case you have something specific in Mind, you can also generate only one of them, too.
If you don't have much Time or want to have a very simple Meal, you can select to have a Dinner made with frozen Goods (e.g. deep-fried Pizza) or choose what Restaurant (Type) to go to.
If you don't have any Preferences at all, there's also a Functionality to take all the Decisions from you.

### Eating Habits

After your favourite Food Type, you are also asked to select Eating Habits to only show Food Options fitted to your Likings.

### Regenerate

If you're not happy with the Dinner that was generated, you can simply press on the Button shown below your Results to get back to the Food Type Selection.
